# React Router Budgeting App

Expenses app built with React Router following Chris Pennington's tutorial at [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzeeBeVWeg).

This approach takes advantage of the new features of React Router 6.8:

- The routes are managed not as Links, but as Form submit requests
- Loader functions provide data to the route element before it renders (so long useEffect!)
- You can access to the current state of the form submission
- Fetcher functions can handle multiple submissions
